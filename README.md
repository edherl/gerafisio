# Protocols - GERAFISIO

Website designed for students and faculty of the postgraduate program at UEPG (State University of Ponta Grossa) and HU/UEPG (University Hospital of UEPG) to access their physical assessments easily and quickly.

On the site, professionals will find information about the standard physical assessment protocols of LAFISE/UEPG and HU/UEPG.

## Project
